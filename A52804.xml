            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>IS a moſt Sacred and undenyable <hi>Truth,</hi> that <hi>The Wicked Plotteth againſt the Righteous.</hi> [Zomem Raſhang le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tſadik.] The Mouth of the Lord (the God of Truth) hath Spoken it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 12. This is the Churches <hi>Malady</hi> in all the Ages of the World; it hath been ſo in times paſt, (both before the Flood, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, under the Law, and under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.) It is ſo in time preſent, and it will be ſo for time to come, until time ſhall be no more. And 'tis as Sacred and certain a <hi>Truth,</hi> That the <hi>Lord laughs all thoſe Plots to nothing,</hi> ver. 13. This is the Churches <hi>Remedy. Deus Videt Ridet,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105736:6"/>
God looks and laughs, he laughs them to ſcorn; when he looks, <hi>that their Day is comming,</hi> even their diſmal Day, wherein they ſhall be <hi>Slain with their own Sword,</hi> v. 14, 15, 17. and <hi>Fall by their own Counſel</hi> (though no Hand be upon them.) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 9, 10. Now while God <hi>laughs</hi> at the Plots of the Wicked, (both to diſgrace the Plotters, and to degrade their Plots,) God's People have little cauſe <hi>to cry;</hi> eſpecially conſidering, that their God is loath to laugh alone, and therefore he tells them of a time, wherein they ſhall laugh (with him) at their over-witted, and over-power'd Adverſaries, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 6. The Cauſe of <hi>the Wickeds Plotting againſt the Righteous</hi> in all Ages, is Twofold; The <hi>1ſt.</hi> is <hi>[Cauſa</hi>

Ever ſince, there hath been a boiſterous and bloody Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (running all along in the Black Line of a carnal Generation,) in all the <hi>Seed of the Serpent</hi> againſt the <hi>Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>: This <hi>Enmity</hi> had <hi>there</hi> its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but it ſhall never have an ending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb facs="tcp:105736:6"/>
the World endeth; Yea, it may be call'd an Eternal Enmity: [a parte poſt] though not [a parte ante,] for as the Angels and the Souls of Men had a beginning, but ſhall never have an end: So this Curſed <hi>Enmity</hi> (which had its beginning at the Fall) will continue beyond this World, even in the World to come. As long as evil Angels and damned Souls continue in Hell, (which ſhall be for ever,) ſo long will this Enmity continue in them againſt the Glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Glorify'd Saints; Thus 'tis a <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs, boundleſs, and endleſs Enmity.</hi> The <hi>2d.</hi> Cauſe is <hi>[Cauſa</hi>

Yea, <hi>3dly.</hi> He is their <hi>God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. and they are his Creatures. And as God (at the Creation of the World) did but <hi>Speak</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>it was done:</hi> So if the Devil (in the Converſation of the
<pb facs="tcp:105736:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wicked) do but ſpeak the word, hold up his ſinger, his will is done; <hi>He leads them Captive at his will,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. He leads them like a Dog in a ſtring, whether he pleaſes, yet hangs them up at laſt (like Dogs) upon everlaſting Gibbits in Hell, where they hang and howl as Dogs, yet never dye; to which if <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Character <hi>[Seſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem habent Diabolum.]</hi> be added, Then <hi>(4ly.)</hi> He is the Rider, and they are his Aſſes, which he Rides upon, whipping and ſpurring them (as <hi>Balaam</hi> did his Aſs,) as if Riding Poſt to meet their own Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And (as ſaith the Proverb) <hi>They muſt needs go</hi> (yea, gallop,) <hi>whom the Devil drives;</hi> eſpecially ſuch as (with the Man in the Goſpel) have a whole legion of Devils in them; ſuch wicked ones (with the <hi>Gadaren's</hi> Hoggs) do <hi>Run Violently down moſt ſteep places,</hi> and moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate praecipices, until (at laſt) <hi>They be choaked in the deep Pit of Hell,</hi> Matth. 8. 32. Now as long as there be the ſame O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Corruption in wicked Men (while this preſent evil World laſts) to be drawn forth; and the ſame Devil (who, whoſoever become Converts, can never become one) to
<pb facs="tcp:105736:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
draw forth that depraved Diſpoſition, ſo long, there will be a wicked Plotting and practiſing againſt the Church of God in the World. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is no new thing under the Sun, the thing that hath been, it is that which ſhall be,</hi> Eccleſ. 1. 9, 10. And the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>As it was then, he that was Born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was Born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit,</hi> (as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did <hi>Iſaac) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo it is now,</hi> Gal. 4. 29. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is ſo, now in my days;</hi> And we may ſay, It is even ſo now in our days: It was ſo then, it is ſo now, and it will be ſo for ever; ſo long as there be any wicked in the World, and the old Man-ſlayer to ſet them on, who is that <hi>Evil Spirit which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> (as the Artificer doth in his Shop) <hi>in the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> Ephe. 2. 3. We Read of the <hi>Dragons</hi> War (but as a ſad Cordolium) with the <hi>Woman</hi> (the Church) and her Seed; <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. And if this War were in Heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 7. how much more on Earth? <hi>v.</hi> 17. This War is manag'd and maintain'd <hi>with great Wrath,</hi> v. 12. having the Aſſiſtance of an Inveterate, Implacable, and Everlaſting Enmity in all
<pb facs="tcp:105736:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
incarnate Devils (his Auxiliaries) all acted and agitated by the Devil, who lends them his <hi>Seven Heads</hi> to Plot with, and his <hi>Ten Horns</hi> to puſh with againſt the Church. And we Read of the Lambs War with this Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, (as <hi>a ſweet and Soveraign Cordial)</hi> even our Bleſſed <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels in the behalf of the <hi>Woman</hi> and her Seed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 7, 8. And though the Beaſt (to <hi>whom the Dragon gave his power,</hi> Rev. 13. 2.) make <hi>War with the Saints, and overcome them,</hi> (during his Leaſe of 1260 y. allotted him) <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7. yet the <hi>Lamb ſhall overcome the Dragon and all his Auxiliaries,</hi> Rev. 17. 14. and 19. 19, 20. <hi>and</hi> 20. 10. And in the mean time, though the Beaſt ſeem to overcome the Saints, (ſo it ſeemed, but ſo it was not) <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7. For the Saints <hi>overcome the Beaſt</hi> (by the <hi>Blood of the Lamb)</hi> when they ſeem to be moſt overcome by him, to the ſhedding of their own Blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 11. This Lamb <hi>Laughs</hi> all the Plots of the Beaſt to nothing, and all <hi>as Vain Things,</hi> whereof no good Reaſon can be given, nor any good Iſſue can be expected. Chriſt ſits in Heaven, ſeeth and Smileth, is no more

concern'd, ſave only to ask the <hi>Many</hi> and the <hi>Mighty</hi> (that Club their Craft and Cruelty againſt Chriſt) <hi>if they be all Mad,</hi> to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that which ſhall aſſuredly come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. The little Stone daſhes all in pieces, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34. So that it may be ſaid of the Church, (as it was ſaid of the old <hi>Romans)</hi> She hath loſt (now and then) a Battel, but never a War. And as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Gad, A Troop may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> Gad, but Gad <hi>overcomes at laſt,</hi> Gen. 49. 19. So the Church <hi>[Concutitur, non Excutitur]</hi> may ſometimes be <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> but never <hi>Shiver'd</hi> into Nothing; She always gets and gains by her Loſſes, and though ſhe may be trampled under Foot all the Night of her Aſfliction, yet is ſhe ſure to have <hi>Dominion in the Morning,</hi> Pſal. 49. 14. And that Morning uſhers in the Diſmal Dooms-Day of all her Enemies.</p>

The ſharper a Weapon is, it makes a deeper wound, and gives a more deadly blow: the ſharpeſt and ſubtileſt Wits are (of all others) the moſt miſchievous Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Devils hands againſt Gods <hi>truth.</hi> This grand <hi>evil Angel</hi> made uſe of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent (which, as ſome ſay, was very ſpecious and delightful to the Eye by his comely mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of lovely Colours) to deceive the firſt Woman, as the <hi>good Angel</hi> made uſe of the Aſs to rebuke the mad Prophet, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 28.</p>

City; the weaker Sex is moſt likely to tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckle to his temptations; hence he Eſſays to break the Mans head with his own Rib, and to make uſe of this Rib, as of the Round of a Ladder, whereon to climb up ſo high, as to Reach a blow to her Head and Husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(3dly.)</hi> He ſets upon <hi>the Woman when alone:</hi> 'Tis ſuppoſed, As <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> walk'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Paradiſe, Eve</hi> ſtood ſtill, gazing with her fancy upon ſome Delectable Object, which <hi>Adam</hi> paſſed by with leſs looking on; he got ſo far before her, as to leave her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, whereby ſhe was overtaken by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter; the abſence of her Head (with its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and comfort) gives Satan a fair opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he improves to the utmoſt. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where Two are, there is Help,</hi> Eccle. 4. 10.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105736:11"/>
(as before) ſo might miſtake the Devil (in the Serpent) for a good Angel, and therefore <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with him,</hi> and <hi>was deceived by him,</hi> (as ſhe confeſſes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 13. So dangerous it is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the Devil, who is <hi>better believ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, than argu'd away.</hi> They do but ſhoot with Satan in his own Bow, that think by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying with this [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>(5thly.)</hi> No ſooner had the Woman put in her weak Anſwer (in this Diſputation) to the Devils Queſtion, mincing the matter of the Divine Menace in her. <hi>[Leaſt ye Dye]</hi> inſtead of Gods Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Hereby her belief of Gods Word is batter'd down, and not oppoſing the certainty of Gods Threatning (which ſhe but ſeem'd to doubt of in the Diſputation) againſt Satans Inſinuation, (in his plain and poſitive

               <p>
                  <hi>(6thly.)</hi> The Tempter tempts her with an Apple from the Forbidden-Fruit-Tree, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her (as ſome ſay) that there was no death in the Apple, (according to the Divine Threatning) from a proof of his own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, For (ſaith the ſubtile Serpent) I do climb the Tree, and eat of the Fruit thereof, and yet am not Dead for ſo doing. This was (probably) done while <hi>Eve</hi> looked on, and therefore ſhe ſaid, (at leaſt in her mind) That ſhe ſaw it <hi>was good for Food,</hi> v. 6. Hereupon ſhe concluded that Death was not in the Fruit of the forbidden-Tree, and hereupon inclines to take and Eat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(7thly.)</hi> The Devil (to promote his Plot the more) accuſes God of Envy, to <hi>Eve,</hi> (which is truly call'd) <hi>Morbus Satanicus,</hi> the Devils own Diſeaſe; as if God had forbid them the Fruit of this Tree of Knowledge, onely out of Envy, leaſt their Eating thereof ſhould make them Equal with God in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Wiſdom. Thus the Devil abuſed the very name of the Tree of Knowledge to her, making it far better than (indeed) it was; as if it would make them as Omniſcient as God: <hi>Thus he muſed, as he uſed,</hi> and would have made God as envious as himſelf, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed that either God ſhould be honoured or

obeyed by Man, or that Man ſhould be Gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Graced by God: Hereupon he tells her, <hi>[Your Eyes ſhall be Opened,]</hi> pretending, to Divine Contemplation, but intending, to Horrible Confuſion, as it proved afterwards, when aſhamed of their Nakedneſs: So that (in <hi>v.</hi> 5.) this <hi>Lyar from the beginning,</hi> was not ſo much <hi>[Mendax]</hi> a Lyar, as <hi>[Fallax]</hi> a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; according to that Antient ſaying, <hi>[Et ſi ſemel videatur Verax, Millies Mendax, &amp; ſemper Fallax.]</hi> Though he ſometimes ſeem to ſpeak truly, yet will he lye a thouſand times for it, and be always Fallacious and Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

               <p>The other Plots before this was a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of leſſer Plots, but <hi>this</hi> laſt <hi>External,</hi> is a <hi>Plot</hi> of <hi>Plots:</hi> the Devil Employing his <hi>Grandeſt Engines</hi> at this Onſett againſt the Church. As <hi>1ſt. Balak</hi> Hires <hi>Balaam</hi> to come and ſecretly Curſe <hi>them,</hi> Numb. 22. 4. 2. He Draws out all his Armies in Battel-Array a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them to Suppreſs them by <hi>Open Power,</hi> Numb. 22. 5. Joſh. 24. 9. as ſoon as <hi>Balaam</hi> had Curſed them. 3.

do, than by Wiles and <hi>Private Policy,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Counſel of <hi>Balaam,</hi> he Seduces them to <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Numb. 25. 1, 2, 3. In the Management of this <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>worſt</hi> Plot, Obſerve Three things, 1. The <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Occaſion.</hi> 2. The <hi>Manner.</hi> 3. The <hi>Matter</hi> thereof. 1. The <hi>Ground,</hi> it was indeed a <hi>groundleſs</hi> quarrel, <hi>for</hi> Moſes <hi>fretted againſt</hi> Iſrael, to ſee them <hi>upon their Plains,</hi> juſt ready to ſet foot upon the Land of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> Numb. 22. 3. though <hi>Moab</hi> was (Allyed to <hi>Iſrael)</hi> eaſed by them of a Troubleſome Incroaching Neighbour, <hi>(Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> that had <hi>taken ſome part of their Land from them,</hi> Numb. 21. 26.) and (3) Aſſur'd by <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they would not meddle with them, or moleſt them, <hi>becauſe they were of the Poſterity of</hi> Lot, Deut. 2. 9. So it was a Cauſeleſs Quarrel, as <hi>Satan moved God againſt</hi> Job <hi>without Cauſe,</hi> Job 2. 3. So they were Acted and Agitated by the Devil without cauſe on <hi>Iſraels</hi> part: they being of a Differing Religion, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with <hi>Satanical malice,</hi> and ſought <hi>their</hi> Ruine.

Secret and Undermining, <hi>Moab</hi> ſent no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Deſiance by ſound of Drum or Trumpet, it was <hi>cloſe</hi> as the Plot of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>us</hi> at
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105736:46"/>
this Day. (2.) It was Earneſt, Importunate and Irreconcileable, for <hi>Balak</hi> was a reſtleſs Adverſary, and would not give over, till ſome Miſchief were done, as <hi>Rome</hi> doth at this Day. (3.) Sumptuous or Coſtly, <hi>Balak</hi> ſpares no Coſt, either in proffering Honours, or in Building of Altars and offering Sacrifices: <hi>Paul</hi> Perſecuted out of Ignorance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. ſo was eaſily Check'd, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 4. but <hi>Balak</hi> out of Malice, as <hi>Rome</hi> does, and ſpares no coſt in her Malice. <hi>3ly. The Matter</hi> of the Plot. (1) <hi>Balak</hi> Hires <hi>Balaam</hi> to Curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Numb. 22. 6. <hi>Balak</hi> was a politick and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Prince, not more Valiant than Vigilant, <hi>Ingenioſe Nequam,</hi> Wittily Wicked; he calls for <hi>Balaam</hi> (the Devils Spelman) to Curſe <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> This <hi>Balaam</hi> (his Inſtrument) is call'd a <hi>Prophet,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 16. there is frequent menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Receiving Meſſages and Anſwers from the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 8, 13, 18. and 24. 17. 'tis ſaid, <hi>God put a Word into</hi> Balaam's <hi>Mouth,</hi> Numb. 23. 5. a Phraſe never uſed concerning the Inſpiring of any of the Holy Prophets, which Word did but paſs through him as a Trunk through which a Man ſpeaks, his Heart was not Holily Affected with what his Tongue uttered; He did not Eat his Words as <hi>Jeremy</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 16. Nor did he Believe what he had ſpoken, as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 106. 10. And after him <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. And as he was call'd <hi>Prophet,</hi> ſo a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105736:47"/>
                  <hi>Sooth-ſayer,</hi> Joſh. 13. 22. As all his Altars, Sacrifices and Conſultations with the Lord were by the Wicked Art of Enchantments, or Obſerving of Fortunes, ſuch as the Diviners and Prophets of the <hi>Heathen</hi> uſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 10, 14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 1. <hi>He went not as at other times to ſeek for Enchantments,</hi> as being Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> however and without <hi>Gods</hi> leave, he was fully bent to do it, and nothing ſhall Hinder him. Thus Satan makes Uſe of the meeteſt <hi>Means</hi> to Accompliſh his <hi>own</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſh Ends, and makes <hi>Balaam</hi> to do more Miſchief to the Church by his <hi>Counſel,</hi> than <hi>Balak</hi> could do by his <hi>Courage:</hi> He lay'd a <hi>Stumbling-Block</hi> before <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Rev. 2. 14. No doubt but this Wicked Perſon had excellent Gifts; yet as he was Famous for <hi>Propheſie,</hi> ſo he was Infamous for <hi>Prophaneſs.</hi> And oh what pernicious Counſel was this of <hi>Balak</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with <hi>Balaam</hi> to have <hi>Iſrael Curſed,</hi> and that, from <hi>Heaven</hi> too, to wit, by the Mouth of a Prophet, this was <hi>more</hi> Dangerous than to Fight againſt <hi>them</hi> with all his Forces: And <hi>Balaam</hi> was as <hi>willing</hi> to Curſe them, as <hi>Balak</hi> would have <hi>had</hi> him, for the <hi>word</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>Jude</hi> 11. Imports it. He powr'd out his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice (like Water in a Spout) after an Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Violent manner, he <hi>Ran</hi> greedily from Altar to Altar, gaping after the Gain <hi>Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> If but his Curſing-Curſed-Work <hi>were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorm'd,</hi> he was like a ſwift ſwelling Torrent
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105736:47"/>
that breaks down all its Banks and Bounds which are made to keep it in. Thus <hi>Balaam</hi>'s March to <hi>Marr</hi> the Church was as furious as <hi>Jehu</hi>'s, ſo that, neither Gods Prohibition <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Journey,</hi> nor the <hi>cruſhing</hi> of his Foot, the <hi>Speaking</hi> of his Aſs, the <hi>drawn</hi> Sword of the Angel in <hi>his Journey,</hi> nor the <hi>Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of all his Endeavours by his Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>afterwards,</hi> could Hinder him from purſuing his Curſed-Curſing Project: yet God made <hi>all</hi> Fruitleſs and fruſtrate, neither had <hi>Balak</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> nor <hi>Balaam</hi> his <hi>Wages:</hi> God <hi>over-rules</hi> the Devil and his Spelman, Turns the <hi>Deſired Curſe</hi> into a <hi>Devout Bleſſing:</hi> gladly would <hi>Balaam</hi> have <hi>Curſed Iſrael,</hi> but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wagg his wicked Tongue without Gods leave, nor <hi>Balak</hi> with <hi>his Men of might could find their Hands</hi> without Divine Permiſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 5. Yea, <hi>Balaams</hi> Heart <hi>Curſes</hi> againſt his Tongue, and his Tongue <hi>Bleſſes</hi> againſt his Heart.</p>
               <p>Let us turn Aſide a little here (with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 3. 2.) and Wonder a while that this Buſh <hi>ſhould be ever Burning, yet never Conſum'd.</hi> Oh let us Admire the Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God towards his Church, both in that Antient and in this preſent <hi>Wilderneſs-State,</hi> as to thoſe Pregnant Parallels follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>1ſt.</hi> Parallel is, As the Church then had a <hi>Balaam</hi> to Curſe her, and a <hi>Balak</hi> to hire

The preſent <hi>Church</hi> of the Reformed <hi>Religion,</hi> hath the Great <hi>Balaam</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to Curſe her with Bel, Book and Candle (as the Phraſe is) he is <hi>The Devils Spellman, [Primo genitus Diaboli]</hi> The Gull and Cheat of the World, to whom the <hi>Balaks</hi> or Kings (that have <hi>given their Power</hi> to that Beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 13.) ſays, <hi>Whom thou bleſſeth ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> and <hi>whom thou curſeth ſhall be curſed,</hi> Num. 22. 6. Whereas the Power given to Man, for Bleſſing or Curſing others, is not Deſpotical or Magiſterial, but onely Miniſterial.</p>
               <p>The <hi>2d.</hi> Paralel, As <hi>Balaam</hi> is call'd a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16. yet a <hi>Mad One,</hi> yea, <hi>a Sooth-ſayer,</hi> Joſh. 13. 22.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105736:48"/>
more <hi>bloody blows</hi> to the Reform'd Religion, (in its Power and Purity) than ever <hi>the Turk</hi> hath done.</p>
               <p>The <hi>3d</hi> Parallel. As <hi>Gain</hi> is the great <hi>Wheel</hi> (or at leaſt the <hi>Yellow <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction)</hi> that made <hi>Balaam</hi> run ſo greedily after his Deſign of <hi>Curſing</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 11.

               <p>The <hi>4th.</hi> Parallel, As <hi>Balaam</hi> Broke through all Difficulties to break Gods Deſign of Bleſſing <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (whom he was Brib'd to Curſe) though (1) a <hi>good Angel</hi> ſtood in his way to ſtop him, (who was Acted and Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

maliciouſly Intended by a Decree obtained upon falſe Informations <hi>that the</hi> Jews <hi>did not keep the Kings Laws,</hi> v. 8. Thus <hi>Haman</hi> cloak'd his private Malice with publique pretences; Oh what a likely Tool had the Devil now got to Work the Churches <hi>Ruine</hi> withal, to wit, the <hi>Adverſary and Enemy Wicked</hi> Haman, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7. 6. where he is painted in his proper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; <hi>The Man-Adverſary,</hi> or <hi>Hebr.</hi> Satan; the Church hath her Man-Adverſary (as well as Devil-Adverſary) a Man of might, and a great <hi>Favourite</hi> at Court, an <hi>

               <p>The <hi>(1ſt.) Remark,</hi> was, The <hi>Harveſt</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> yea, and of <hi>Heaven</hi> too, was <hi>fully Ripe,</hi> when God Rais'd up <hi>Luther</hi> to put in his <hi>ſharp Sicle</hi> (1.) <hi>that of Earth,</hi> the Kingdom of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was ſo Debauch'd in that Day; as if <hi>Earth</hi> had been turned into <hi>Hell,</hi> inſomuch as <hi>Geffery Chaucer</hi> (that learned Poet in the <hi>14th.</hi> Century) doth notably Scourge the <hi>Romiſh-Church</hi> for <hi>Degenerating</hi> ſo notoriouſly both in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> both in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners:</hi> (2.) <hi>that of Heaven;</hi> the <hi>Kingdome of Chriſt</hi> had then a whole Harveſt of Souls <hi>(Choſen of God)</hi> to be effectually called, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſuch a poor <hi>Fryar</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> was) could never have gone through ſo <hi>great</hi> a <hi>Work</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo <hi>Great</hi> and General <hi>Oppoſition</hi> with ſuch <hi>Great Succeſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>(2d.) Famous Remark,</hi> was, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſhould be ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> as Meſſenger of his <hi>Covent,</hi> for Deciding ſome Controverſies therein, (about the <hi>Monks</hi> Priviledges) before the <hi>Pope,</hi> in the Y. 1510. <hi>where</hi> beholding the Baſe and Abominable Manners of the Roman <hi>Clergy,</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and of his <hi>Pallace,</hi> he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Rome</hi> with Utmoſt Deteſtation both of <hi>it,</hi> and of <hi>its Religion,</hi> crying out often, <hi>Away with it, Away with it,</hi> and ſaying to his Friends, He would not have been without <hi>that</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The (3) <hi>Remark,</hi> was, <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> through his Luxury wanted Money to beſtow a <hi>Dowry</hi> on his Siſter <hi>(Magdalen,)</hi> and ſo did his <hi>Cardinal,</hi> to pay for his <hi>New-Pall,</hi> both thoſe Summs muſt be raiſed by <hi>Indulgences</hi> ſent into <hi>Germany: Tecelius</hi> (a <hi>Dominican Fryar)</hi> brings them to be ſold, ſaying, His <hi>Commiſſion</hi> was ſo large from the <hi>Pope,</hi> that if a Man had <hi>Defloured</hi> the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> he could <hi>Pardon</hi> the Sin for <hi>Money;</hi> yea, he could <hi>Pardon</hi> all <hi>Sins to come,</hi> as well as any that were <hi>paſt; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed much what alike.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>(4th.) Eminent Remark,</hi> was, that God ſhould provide ſuch a <hi>Protector</hi> (as <hi>Frederick,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony)</hi> to preſerve poor perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>Luther</hi> out of the Hands of <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> and of the <hi>Emperor Charles the 5th.</hi> (whom the <hi>Pope</hi> provok'd againſt him) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his <hi>Patmos,</hi> (as he call'd <hi>Wartenburg-Caſtle)</hi> and ſometimes Diſputing with Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Caietan,</hi> and with thoſe <hi>Devils</hi> in the Court at <hi>Worms,</hi> yet was he kept ſecure by Gods <hi>good</hi>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:105736:241"/>
                  <hi>Providence,</hi> till he had <hi>Fulfill'd his Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>Finiſh'd the Work</hi> his Father gave him to do, Living to the Age of Sixty-Three, then Dyed in his Climacterical Year, Bequeathing his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of <hi>Popery</hi> to his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Followers,</hi> with this Verſe,</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>(5th.) Marvelous Remark,</hi> was, That <hi>not One of thoſe Three Angels,</hi> (forementioned) to wit, <hi>Waldus, Wickliff,</hi> and <hi>Luther, ſhould Dye a Violent Death;</hi> Conſidering the Rage of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> againſt them all, That <hi>They</hi> ſhould all Three Dye quietly in their Beds in the midſt of their mortal Enemies, to whom they all Three were ſo miſchievous, was little below a <hi>Miracle:</hi> Well, therefore are they Named <hi>More than Men,</hi> even <hi>Angels,</hi> Rev. 14. 6, 8, 9.

Chap. 15. 1, 7.
