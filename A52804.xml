            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now while God <hi>laughs</hi> at the Plots of the Wicked, (both to di≈øgrace the Plotters, and to degrade their Plots,) God's People have little cau≈øe <hi>to cry;</hi> e≈øpecially con≈øidering, that their God is loath to laugh alone, and therefore he tells them of a time, wherein they ≈øhall laugh (with him) at their over-witted, and over-power'd Adver≈øaries, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 52. 6.

               <p>The <hi>(1≈øt.) Remark,</hi> was, The <hi>Harve≈øt</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> yea, and of <hi>Heaven</hi> too, was <hi>fully Ripe,</hi> when God Rais'd up <hi>Luther</hi> to put in his <hi>≈øharp Sicle</hi> (1.) <hi>that of Earth,</hi> the Kingdom of the <hi>Bea≈øt</hi> was ≈øo Debauch'd in that Day; as if <hi>Earth</hi> had been turned into <hi>Hell,</hi> in≈øomuch as <hi>Geffery Chaucer</hi> (that learned Poet in the <hi>14th.</hi> Century) doth notably Scourge the <hi>Romi≈øh-Church</hi> for <hi>Degenerating</hi> ≈øo notoriou≈øly both in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Di≈øcipline,</hi> both in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners:</hi> (2.) <hi>that of Heaven;</hi> the <hi>Kingdome of Chri≈øt</hi> had then a whole Harve≈øt of Souls <hi>(Cho≈øen of God)</hi> to be effectually called, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe ≈øuch a poor <hi>Fryar</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> was) could never have gone through ≈øo <hi>great</hi> a <hi>Work</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt ≈øo <hi>Great</hi> and General <hi>Oppo≈øition</hi> with ≈øuch <hi>Great Succe≈øs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>(2d.) Famous Remark,</hi> was, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ≈øhould be ≈øent to <hi>Rome,</hi> as Me≈ø≈øenger of his <hi>Covent,</hi> for Deciding ≈øome Controver≈øies therein, (about the <hi>Monks</hi> Priviledges) before the <hi>Pope,</hi> in the Y. 1510. <hi>where</hi> beholding the Ba≈øe and Abominable Manners of the Roman <hi>Clergy,</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and of his <hi>Pallace,</hi> he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Rome</hi> with Utmo≈øt Dete≈øtation both of <hi>it,</hi> and of <hi>its Religion,</hi> crying out often, <hi>Away with it, Away with it,</hi> and ≈øaying to his Friends, He would not have been without <hi>that</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The (3) <hi>Remark,</hi> was, <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> through his Luxury wanted Money to be≈øtow a <hi>Dowry</hi> on his Si≈øter <hi>(Magdalen,)</hi> and ≈øo did his <hi>Cardinal,</hi> to pay for his <hi>New-Pall,</hi> both tho≈øe Summs mu≈øt be rai≈øed by <hi>Indulgences</hi> ≈øent into <hi>Germany: Tecelius</hi> (a <hi>Dominican Fryar)</hi> brings them to be ≈øold, ≈øaying, His <hi>Commi≈ø≈øion</hi> was ≈øo large from the <hi>Pope,</hi> that if a Man had <hi>Defloured</hi> the <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed Virgin,</hi> he could <hi>Pardon</hi> the Sin for <hi>Money;</hi> yea, he could <hi>Pardon</hi> all <hi>Sins to come,</hi> as well as any that were <hi>pa≈øt; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed much what alike.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>(4th.) Eminent Remark,</hi> was, that God ≈øhould provide ≈øuch a <hi>Protector</hi> (as <hi>Frederick,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony)</hi> to pre≈øerve poor per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>Luther</hi> out of the Hands of <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> and of the <hi>Emperor Charles the 5th.</hi> (whom the <hi>Pope</hi> provok'd again≈øt him) ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his <hi>Patmos,</hi> (as he call'd <hi>Wartenburg-Ca≈øtle)</hi> and ≈øometimes Di≈øputing with Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Caietan,</hi> and with tho≈øe <hi>Devils</hi> in the Court at <hi>Worms,</hi> yet was he kept ≈øecure by Gods <hi>good</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>(5th.) Marvelous Remark,</hi> was, That <hi>not One of tho≈øe Three Angels,</hi> (forementioned) to wit, <hi>Waldus, Wickliff,</hi> and <hi>Luther, ≈øhould Dye a Violent Death;</hi> Con≈øidering the Rage of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> again≈øt them all, That <hi>They</hi> ≈øhould all Three Dye quietly in their Beds in the mid≈øt of their mortal Enemies, to whom they all Three were ≈øo mi≈øchievous, was little below a <hi>Miracle:</hi> Well, therefore are they Named <hi>More than Men,</hi> even <hi>Angels,</hi> Rev. 14. 6, 8, 9.
